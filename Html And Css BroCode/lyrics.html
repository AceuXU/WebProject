Things haven't been quite the same
There's a haze on the horizon, babe
It's only been a couple of days
And I miss you, mm, yeah

When nothin' really goes to plan
You stub your toe or break your camera
I'll do everythin' I can
To help you through
If you're feelin' down

I just wanna make you happier, baby
Wish I was around
I just wanna make you happier, baby
We've been doin' all this late night talkin'
'Bout anythin' you want until the mornin'

Now you're in my life
I can't get you off my mind
I've never been a fan of change
But I'd follow you to any place
If it's Hollywood or Bishopsgate

I'm coming too
If you're feelin' down
I just wanna make you happier, baby
Wish I was around

I just wanna make you happier, baby
We've been doin' all this late night talkin'
'Bout anythin' you want until the mornin'
Now you're in my life
I can't get you off my mind
